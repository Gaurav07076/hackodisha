#### An E-commerce Platform for Local Traders and Vendors in India
In the rapidly evolving digital age, local traders and vendors in India face a significant challenge â€“ the shift to online markets. While e-commerce presents new opportunities, it also poses a threat to the rich culture and heritage of India. To address this challenge and protect the hard work of local artisans and traders, we have developed "Local Lane," an innovative e-commerce platform.

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
India is a country with a rich and diverse culture and heritage, where local traders and vendors play a vital role in preserving and promoting the traditional crafts, arts, and products of their regions. However, with the advent of online shopping and e-commerce, these local traders and vendors face many challenges and threats, such as:

* Lack of access to a wider market and customer base
* Lack of digital skills and resources to create and manage their own online presence
* Competition from large-scale and standardized e-commerce platforms that offer lower prices and faster delivery
- Loss of identity and uniqueness of their products due to mass production and imitation
- Loss of income and livelihood due to reduced demand and sales

These challenges pose a serious risk to the survival and sustainability of the local traders and vendors, as well as the cultural diversity and heritage of India.

### Our Solution

To address these challenges, we have created Local Lane, an e-commerce platform that enables the local traders and vendors in India to sell their products easily on the Internet. Local Lane is designed to:

- Provide a simple and user-friendly interface for both sellers and buyers
- Connect the local traders and vendors with customers across India who are interested in their products
- Showcase the variety and quality of the products offered by the local traders and vendors
- Highlight the stories and backgrounds of the local traders and vendors, as well as the cultural significance and value of their products
- Support the local traders and vendors with digital skills training, marketing assistance, and payment security
Local Lane is not just an e-commerce platform, but also a social enterprise that aims to protect and empower the local traders and vendors, as well as to preserve and celebrate the rich culture and heritage of India.

## Deployment

To run the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
  * Clone the repository on your local system.
  * Open the folder in VS Code. Then open a new terminal
  * Note: we need Node and typesccript

  In Terminal:

  npm install in the root folder 
  Then cd/packages/database to go into the database folder
  run npx prisma migrate dev --name init  {this generate schema in database}
  cd ../..
  Then run:
  npm run dev

  Now open localhost:5173 from your browser 
```

## TechStack

Local Lane uses the following technologies for its development:

- Frontend: The frontend of the platform is developed using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React uses components to create reusable and interactive UI elements. React also uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking and other features. The frontend also uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create the layout and style of the web pages.
- Backend: The backend of the platform is developed using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment that executes the code on the server side. Node.js uses Express, a web framework that provides tools and features for creating web applications. Express also uses TypeScript to enhance the code quality and readability. The backend also uses Recoil, a state management library that provides a way to share data across components.
- Database: The database of the platform is developed using PostgreSQL, a relational database management system that stores and manages the data in tables with predefined schemas. PostgreSQL also uses Prisma, an object-relational mapper that abstracts the database operations from the application logic. Prisma also uses TypeScript to generate type-safe and auto-completed queries.


**Client:** React, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, BootStrap
